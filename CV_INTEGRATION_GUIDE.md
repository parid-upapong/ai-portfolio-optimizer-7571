The output from `VisualIntelligencePipeline` is fed into the **LLM Orchestration Layer** (LangChain). 

## How the AI Partner uses this:
1.  **Style Matching:** If the CV detects "Minimalist" but the user is applying for a "Brutalist" design role, the AI suggests adjusting the portfolio narrative to highlight structural bold choices.
2.  **Narrative Enhancement:** Instead of a user saying "I made a logo," the AI uses the color palette data: "Leveraging a high-trust blue palette (#0052FF), I designed a visual identity that increased user perceived reliability by 40%."
3.  **SEO/Tagging:** Automates the generation of hyper-accurate metadata for portfolio discoverability.
