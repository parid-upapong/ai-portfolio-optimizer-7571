# Strategic Roadmap: AI Career Partner Evolution

## Phase 1: Foundations - The Intelligent Builder (Q3 2024)
*   **MVP Launch:** AI-assisted portfolio creation with "Storytelling Mode."
*   **Dynamic Layouts:** Generative UI that adjusts based on the creator's industry (Design, Dev, Marketing).
*   **Basic SEO/ATS Optimization:** Ensuring portfolios are readable by both AI and human recruiters.

## Phase 2: Strategic Insights - The Market Matcher (Q4 2024)
*   **Skill Gap Analysis:** AI compares the portfolio against 10,000+ job descriptions to suggest "missing links."
*   **Impact Scoring:** Quantifying project results using AI-driven estimations.
*   **Multi-Version Control:** Create "Strategic Variants" of one portfolio for different career paths (e.g., UX Designer vs. Product Designer).

## Phase 3: The Career Coach - Growth & Conversion (Q1-Q2 2025)
*   **AI Interview Simulation:** AI roleplays as a recruiter based specifically on the user's uploaded portfolio.
*   **Direct-to-Opportunity:** Automated matching where the system suggests the user to recruiters looking for their specific "Strategic Profile."
*   **Continuous Learning:** Tracking market shifts and notifying the user when their portfolio needs a "strategic refresh."
