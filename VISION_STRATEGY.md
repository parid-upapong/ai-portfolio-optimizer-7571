# Vision: The AI-Powered Career Partner for Creators

## 1. Executive Summary
Our goal is to transcend the concept of a static "portfolio" and evolve it into a dynamic "Strategic Asset." By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vector Databases, we provide creators with a tool that doesn't just show what they've done, but explains why they are the perfect fit for specific high-value opportunities.

## 2. Core Value Propositions

*   **Market Alignment:** Real-time analysis of industry trends to suggest portfolio adjustments that match current demand.
*   **Precision Targeting:** Customizing portfolio views for specific employers or roles automatically.
*   **Career Trajectory Mapping:** Identifying skill gaps and recommending projects to reach the "next level" of seniority.
